# Simple example of a redux style state implementation

A Redux style state implementation which has been used for a series of tutorial workshops I have put together on the topic of how Redux works under the hood.

See [simpleState](./src/simpleState/) for the implementation.

See [app/index.tsx](./app/index.tsx) for a high level example of creating actions, reducers and connecting a React component
to the store.
